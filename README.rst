``webdrivermanager``
=======================

Python module to facilitate downloading and deploying `WebDriver <https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/>`_ binaries.  The classes in this module can be used to automatically search for and download the latest version (or a specific version) of a WebDriver binary (by default, will download to ``$HOME/webdriver`` or ``/usr/local/webdriver`` if run with ``sudo``. If virtualenv is activated when running webdrivermanager, download is stored within it), extract the binary from the downloaded archive and create a symlink in either ``/usr/local/bin`` (if run with ``sudo``) or ``$HOME/bin``.


This project is a fork of https://github.com/leonidessaguisagjr/webdriverdownloader

Example module usage
--------------------

Example::

   >>> from webdrivermanager import GeckoDriverManager
   >>> gdd = GeckoDriverManager()
   >>> gdd.download_and_install()
   1524kb [00:00, 1631.24kb/s]
   ('/Users/lsaguisag/webdriver/geckodriver-v0.20.1-macos/geckodriver', '/Users/lsaguisag/bin/geckodriver')
   >>> gdd.download_and_install("v0.20.0")

   Symlink /Users/lsaguisag/bin/geckodriver already exists and will be overwritten.
   ('/Users/lsaguisag/webdriver/geckodriver-v0.20.0-macos/geckodriver', '/Users/lsaguisag/bin/geckodriver')
   >>> gdd.download_and_install()
   Symlink /Users/lsaguisag/bin/geckodriver already exists and will be overwritten.
   ('/Users/lsaguisag/webdriver/geckodriver-v0.20.1-macos/geckodriver', '/Users/lsaguisag/bin/geckodriver')
   >>>


Command line tool
-----------------

There is a command-line tool that is also available.  After installing the package, it can be used as follows (Windows example)::

   > webdrivermanager chrome:2.38 firefox opera:v.2.35
   Downloading WebDriver for browser: 'chrome'
   3300kb [00:00, 11216.38kb/s]
   Driver binary downloaded to: C:\Users\lsaguisag\webdriver\chrome\2.38\2.38%2Fchromedriver_win32\chromedriver.exe
   Driver copied to: C:\Users\lsaguisag\bin\chromedriver.exe

   Downloading WebDriver for browser: 'firefox'
   3031kb [00:01, 2253.64kb/s]
   Driver binary downloaded to: C:\Users\lsaguisag\webdriver\gecko\v0.20.1\geckodriver-v0.20.1-win64\geckodriver.exe
   Driver copied to: C:\Users\lsaguisag\bin\geckodriver.exe

   Downloading WebDriver for browser: 'opera'
   3548kb [00:02, 1239.02kb/s]
   Driver binary downloaded to: C:\Users\lsaguisag\webdriver\operachromium\v.2.35\operadriver_win64\operadriver_win64\operadriver.exe
   Driver copied to: C:\Users\lsaguisag\bin\operadriver.exe

   WARNING: Path 'C:\Users\lsaguisag\bin' is not in the PATH environment variable.

In the above example, a version was specified for Chrome and Opera while no version was specified for Firefox so the latest version of ``geckodriver`` was implicitly downloaded.
